name="getting-into-the-game" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Getting into the game</span></h2><p><span>Arenanet recently started to add achievments to give new players guidance in the beginning of the game. Those can be easily used to just jump into the game. So after creating your charakter you can just start working on these if you prefer a quickstart. If you play with friends don&#39;t worry about choosing the same Race to play to gether, the first waypoitn of every race is always accessible so you can play together if you want.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/tutorial_achievments.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Tutorial Achievments"></p><hr /><h1><a name="chapter-0-basic-terminology" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Chapter 0: Basic Terminology</span></h1><ul><li><p><span>If numbers are used the base value for level 80 and or the rarity exotic is used. Other level or rarity gear/skills have different numbers.</span></p></li><li><p><span>CC means </span><a href='#3.x Break-bars and Crowd Control'><span>Crowd-Control</span></a><span>. Generally that refers to skills that in some way restrict the control an enemy has over his character.</span></p></li><li><p><span>The game scales you down when visiting lower level areas, so don&#39;t think it is an issue to play with friends who are a lower level.</span></p></li><li><p><span>You don&#39;t have to worry about griefing since you will get rewards for a mob for simply participating in the kill, even if you do not deliver the first, or the finishing blow.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Because of how the game works there is no downtime on patchdays. Also the server selection only matters for world vs. world. If you are interested in the technical aspect, click </span><a href='http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1016640/Guild-Wars-2-Programming-the'><span>Here</span></a><span> to see a technical presentation by an engineer about how it works.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Guild Wars 1 has had about 24 hours of downtime so far in about 13 years.</span></p></blockquote></li></ul><h2><a name="01-races" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.1 Races</span></h2><blockquote><p><span>It is no problem for new players that want to play together to get different races, since the first way point in every starting region is unlocked for every player from the beginning. </span>
<span>This enables new players to play with their friends even if they just have free to play accounts.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>What race you choose only has an impact on the story of the game. While there are a few racial skills that are unique to them, they are designed to not be very strong, so that one race is not preferential over another.</span></p><h3><a name="011-norn" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.1.1 Norn</span></h3><p><span>The Norn are a race of hunters who were pushed from their homeland far to the north by the elder dragon Jormag. They have a similar appearance to a human but are often much larger averaging 2.7 meters tall and large in figure. They have no main government but congragate in the city of Hoelbrak. These large hunters listen to the sypirits of the wild and have the ability to transform.</span></p><h3><a name="012-charr" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.1.2 Charr</span></h3><p><span>The Charr are a feline race native to Tyria. 250 years ago they fought one of their final major offensives in the  war against the humans to reclaim territories taken from them. Their main city in the game is the Black Citadel, built on the ruins of the old human kingdom of Ascalon. Since then the conflict is still going on and relations are complicated between Humans and Charr.</span></p><h3><a name="013-asura" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.1.3 Asura</span></h3><p><span>The Asura are one of the older races. Though not native to the surface they were forced out of the underground by the elder dragon Primordus. They are best known for their intelligence, technological advantages and their inflated ego. Their main city is Rata Sum, built after they had to escape the underground.</span></p><h3><a name="014-sylvari" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.1.4 Sylvari</span></h3><p><span>The Sylvari are the youngest race of the planet, only having come to life ~25 years before the events of Guild Wars 2. Their main city is the Grove, where they all awaken from the dream, the mysterious stage of consciousness that they experience prior to their awakening, to come into this world.</span></p><h3><a name="015-humans" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.1.5 Humans</span></h3><p><span>Humans are the only non-native race on the planet that the player can choose. While a thriving force on Tyria in the older times, they are only a shadow of their former glory and influence. Their capital City is Divinity&#39;s Reach, one of the last major human cities.</span></p><h2><a name="02-questing-and-leveling" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.2 Questing and Leveling</span></h2><h3><a name="021-questing" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.2.1 Questing</span></h3><p><span>Questing in Guild Wars works very different to other games.</span></p><p><span>First, there is the personal story. These are story missions you get every 10 levels if you are under level 80 or just back to back if you play the expansion story / living world story.</span></p><p><span>For leveling you would usually quest in other MMOs or grind mobs. In Guild Wars 2 quests do not exist. However you will find hearts scattered around the map. These are basically locally bound quest that you automatically accept once you enter the area and halt once you leave it again. </span></p><p><span>Another thing are hero points (yellow &quot;arrows&quot; on the map). They will give you hero points you can spend on leveling.</span></p><p><span>The third big thing are events. These will be shown in orange on your map. They spawn randomly around the world and every player can participate.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>As you can see guild wars encourages you to explore the world to level. This also however means that there is no straight &quot;direction&quot; to start. You can visit the other starting areas and quest a bit there, or just play in yours.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Therefore openly exloring the map is the best way to level up.</span></p><h3><a name="022-leveling" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>0.2.2 Leveling</span></h3><p><span>When leveling up or completing hero challenges in the world you get hero points which you can spend to learn new skills. You do this by opening your character menu with </span><strong><span>H</span></strong><span> and pressing the training tab. Often traits and skills have synergies, so be sure to read the skills and traits to find what things will work together.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/leveling.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Leveling"></p><blockquote><p><span>Do not worry to much about what traits and skills to level, you will be able to unlock them all.</span></p></blockquote><p><a href='#guild-wars-2-new-player-tutorial'><span>To the top</span></a></p><hr /><h1><a name="chapter-1-the-user-interface" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Chapter 1: The User Interface</span></h1><h2><a name="11-general-interface" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.1 General Interface</span></h2><p><img src="img/en/complete.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Complete"></p><p><span>The user interface can be separated into different areas on the screen.

However, in order to be most effective in combat there are two things you have to keep in mind. The first one is dodging. It grants you a small time frame in which you evade all incoming attack. It will be your bread and butter for surviving. The other thing is jumping. Many bosses will have attacks that you can actually jump over in order to not be hit.    </span></p><p><span>Generally you can and should be moving while casting your abilities, there are however some skills that lock you in place.</span></p><h2><a name="22-tab-targeting" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>2.2 Tab Targeting</span></h2><p><span>Initially the game only utilized the well known tab targeting.

Elements such as dodging, blocking or evading are not a numbered chance based upon your character, these abilites can be activated by the player when needed.

Dodging is the most useful and most used skill in the game. All classes have the ability to dodge and a perfect dodge roll can completely mitigate all damage and effects from an attack. Dodging uses endurance which is denoted by the yellow bars above your health orb. The default key for dodging is &quot;Left Shift&quot; while moving in any direction pressing your bound dodge key will roll you in that direction, repositioning you and &quot;dodging&quot; the incoming effect.</span></p><h2><a name="33-weapons--skills" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>3.3 Weapons &amp; Skills</span></h2><p><span>The skill bar is made up of ten main skills with multiple class specific ones.

Arenanet wanted to move away from this as they felt sticking people in certain roles was less intuitive than allowing all classes to fill roles as necessary. This &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; style also meant players could be waiting for long periods of time for the exact class needed to complete certain content. This led to Arenanet creating their own style of trinity which is Support, Damage, Control. Initially this concept was recieved well but quickly led to all classes just running full damage builds as it was easier to kill a boss quickly than it was to bring support classes and make the fight longer. With more difficult content such as &quot;Fractals of the Mist&quot; and &quot;Raids&quot; as well as the creation of &quot;Elite Specializations&quot; Guild Wars 2 has started to find it&#39;s way into a healthy middle ground where certain roles are needed such as Tanks and Healers but &quot;balance permitting&quot;, these roles can be filled by different classes.

Each piece of armor has one rune slot, allowing you to equip a total of six. The more of the same rune you stack the stronger the effect becomes. On lower levels this is capped at two stacks, on higher levels it goes up to six.

One being food, the other being Enhancements. They can be applied at the same time, however only one of each type. this means eating food replaces any food buff you may have had.</span>

While it is perfectly possible to play all three, they are very different and some players will gravitate to certain modes. If you find yourself disliking a particular mode you might try the others to see if they are more fun for you.</span></p><h2><a name="61-player-versus-player" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>6.1: Player versus Player</span></h2><p><span>One important note about PvP is that there is no gear grind. Stats are handled with amulets you can equip. While some of them have a small up front initial cost this enables the game to be fair balanced stat wise. Someone just joining has the same tools to win like an experienced player.</span></p><h2><a name="62-world-versus-world" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>6.2: World versus World</span></h2><p><span>Opposed to  PvP a gear grind technically exists in WvW since it doesn&#39;t use amulets but the PvE weapons and armor you wear. This means that you have way more freedom in your builds, but at the same time have to take care of having decent equipment.</span></p><h2><a name="63-player-versus-environment" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>6.3: Player versus Environment</span></h2><p><span>PvE content largely consists of Dungeons, raids, Fractals and story (Living World and Expansions).</span></p><h2><a name="631-living-world-and-expansions" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>6.3.1 Living World and Expansions</span></h2><p><a href='#guild-wars-2-new-player-tutorial'><span>To the top</span></a></p><hr /><h1><a name="chapter-7-social" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Chapter 7: Social</span></h1><h2><a name="71-looking-for-group-lfg" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>7.1: Looking For Group (LFG)</span></h2><p><span>The LFG is the main way for you to find players to play with. For dungeons, casual roleplay, personal story or achievements, this is your go to way to find players.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/lfg.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="LFG"></p><p><span>It is separated into different categories. In order for you to jump into it, here is a short list of common abreveations used in the LFG:</span></p><p><strong><span>Taxi</span></strong>
<span>Because the game uses a mega server system there are often multiple instances of the same map. In order to get every player on the same map (for example to do a world boss) players might offer Taxis. Using a taxi is rather simple. Join the group and go to the map. If you happen to not be on the same instance (which you will see by the health bars not being shown in the top left) you can right-click on a name up there and use </span></p><blockquote><p><span>join </span><mapname></p></blockquote><ul><li><strong><span>p1 / p2 / p3</span></strong><span> : This is a term commonly used when doing dungeons. It refers to which of the explorable paths the group intends to clear.</span></li><li><strong><span>KP</span></strong><span>: KP means kill-proof. For raids or high level fractals players sometimes demand kill proofs to know that the player joining has some experience with the content.</span></li></ul><h2><a name="72-guilds" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>7.2: Guilds</span></h2><p><span>Guilds are formed by groups of players. A guild can have up to 500 members. The specialty of the guild system in Guild Wars 2 is that every player has the ability to be in 5 Guilds at the same time. They are account wide, but each character can separately select which guild to represent, meaning that you have the tag besides your name and see its players on the worldmap. Besides that guilds offer guild missions, which can be done weekly in order to gain special rewards. For 100 gold a guild can also buy a guildhall which can be leveled up in order to gain special vendors among other things. There are some tie in of guilds with World vs World, mainly that a guild can claim outposts after capturing them.</span></p><p><a href='#guild-wars-2-new-player-tutorial'><span>To the top</span></a></p><hr /><h1><a name="chapter-8-end-game-content" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Chapter 8: End Game Content</span></h1><h2><a name="81-fractals-of-the-mist-fotm" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>8.1 Fractals of the Mist (FotM)</span></h2><p><span>The fractals of the mist are five player instances that act like mini-dungeons. They have a unique mechanic called &quot;Agony&quot;. There are currently 18 different fractals and 100 fractal levels. Higher levels are harder and require agony-resistance, but also grant more rewards. For the lower levels no special equipment is needed. In order to get agony-resistance ascended armor is required.</span></p><h2><a name="82-dungeons" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>8.2 Dungeons</span></h2><p><span>Dungeons are the oldest end game content in the game. They were present at the release of the game, and while not being as actively pursued as other content they still are worthwhile for learning the game, getting equipment and a decent amount of money. There are 8 dungeons in the game. Each dungeon has one story path and three exploration paths (which are the ones being done for reward). One exception is the last one, which has five paths in total. Dungeons are five man content. Even though some of the dungeons have a lower recommended level they are actually decent level 80 content because of the scaling mechanism.</span></p><p><span>All dungeons offer unique skins as well as food and runes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Ascalonian Catacombs</span></strong><span>: Level: 30-35</span></p><p><span>The Ascalonian Catacombs are the first dungeon you will be introduced to in the game. Go into the ancient Ascalonian Catacombs near the black citadel.</span></p><p><strong><span>Caudecus&#39;s Manner</span></strong><span>: Level 40-45</span></p><p><span>Find out what mysteries lie in the Manner of Caudecus Beetlestone the Wise, Legate Minister of the Krytan Ministry, located in Beetletun near Divinitys Reach.</span></p><p><strong><span>Twilight Arbor</span></strong><span>: Level 50-55 (80 for the Aetherpath)</span></p><p><span>Find out what the Nightmare Court is up to.

They were first introduced with the Heart of Thorns expansion. In order to be able to play raids you need the Expansion in which they ship. There are currently five Raid wings. Raiding itself is a bit out of scope of this tutorial, so you might want to check out the </span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit#heading=h.2s8eyo1'><span>Happy Raiders Kit</span></a><span> if you intend to pursue them.</span></p><p><strong><span>Forsaken Thicket</span></strong></p><p><span>The Forsaken Thicket is the first Raid introduced into the Game. It is seperated into 3 Wings, the first of which was released a few weeks after the launch of Heart of Thorns.</span></p><p><strong><span>Spirit Vale</span></strong><span> </span></p><p><span>Spirit Vale is the first Wing of the Forsaken Thicket, consisting of 3 distinct bosses as well as events between them. Enter it to find out what happened to the lost Pact squad.</span></p><p><strong><span>Salvation Pass</span></strong></p><p><span>Salvation Pass is the second Wing. It also features 3 boss encounters. Venture deeper into the Thicket to save what you can of the squad.</span></p><p><strong><span>Stronghold of the Faithful</span></strong></p><p><span>The third wing of the first raid also features 3 boss encounters.

Enter the stronghold of the white mantle to stop them in their evil deeds.</span></p><p><strong><span>Bastion of the Penitent</span></strong></p><p><span>Bastion of the Penitent is the second Raid, consisting of a single Wing. Fight against 4 bosses in order to unveil its mysteries.</span></p><p><strong><span>Hall of Chains</span></strong>
<span>Hall of Chains is the newest Raid released and the only one not being part of Heart of Thorns. Venture into the underworld to find out what is happening in the realm of the dead.</span></p><h2><a name="84-fashion-wars" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>8.4 Fashion Wars</span></h2><p><span>A really big part of Guild Wars 2 is Fashion. The game has a rather complex skin system, you can read more about it in </span><a href='#56-skins'><span>chapter 5.6</span></a><span>. For many people the end goal in the game is to collect certain skins. Many are relatively easy to get, but the most prestigious ones take time and effort to acquire.</span></p><h2><a name="85-pvp" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>8.5 PVP</span></h2><p><span>Personally I am not much of a PvP player, so this section is cut rather short. There is a league system in the game. PvP also offers reward tracks, meaning that you can select a track and every game you play gives you progress towards is, with loot at certain stages and a grand chest at the end. As well as that there is an automated tournament system with multiple tournaments per day and a really big monthly tournament. Winning that grants you a statue in the heart of the mists, the PvP lobby of the game. PvP offers to you acquire a unique legendary backpack.</span></p><h2><a name="86-wvw" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>8.6 WvW</span></h2><p><span>Similar to PvP I don&#39;t know much about WvW. World vs World is a massive scale PvP where servers fight against one another to seize control of 3 regions. Similar to PvP it offers reward tracks and has its own legendary backpack you can acquire.</span></p><p><a href='#guild-wars-2-new-player-tutorial'><span>To the top</span></a></p><hr /><h1><a name="chapter-9-other" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Chapter 9: Other</span></h1><h2><a name="91-inventory-management" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>9.1 Inventory Management</span></h2><p><span>Inventory management can be a huge part of MMOs. Guild Wars tries to make it as little painful as possible.  One of the unusual things you can do in GW is deposit all materials in your inventory to your material storage with one click.</span></p><p><span>On the bottom left you see a button that shows you your wallet. Meaning all the different currencies. On the bottom right you see gold and a currency relevant to the map if it exists, or karma otherwise.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/inventory.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Inventory"></p><p><span>The inventory size is determined by the amount and quality of bags (left row) you have. Bags go from 5 to 32 slots and you can have up to 8 bags. In the top most row you can see shared inventory slots, which are, as the name implies shared between all characters. They are pretty expensive but might be worth the hassle.</span></p><p><strong><span>Unidentified Gear</span></strong>
<span>In order to further ease inventory management Arenanet added unidentified gear. This is gera of a certain rarity that can stack. Most dropped gear will come in this form.  This allowes to have a huge amount of gear in the inventory  without it taking up much space.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/gear.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Salvage"></p><p><strong><span>Salvaging</span></strong><span> </span>
<span>Salvaging found equipment can be done to get materials out of them. For salvaging you will need salvage kits. If you don&#39;t want to click every single item salvage kits offer the option to salvage all of a specific type.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/salvage_all.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Salvage"></p><h2><a name="92-crafting" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>9.2 Crafting</span></h2><p><span>Guild Wars 2 has a huge crafting system. To explain it in detail would be out of scope for this tutorial, but I will try to give a broad overview.</span></p><p><span>There are 9 crafting disciplines, each being responsible for other pieces of equipment. Each character can learn 2 disciplines by default. Switching on of these out is possible at all times for a small fee.</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Armorsmith</span></strong><span> for crafing heavy armor</span></li><li><strong><span>Artificer</span></strong><span> for magical weapons (focus, staff, scepter, trident)</span></li><li><strong><span>Chef</span></strong><span>  for food and dyes</span></li><li><strong><span>Huntsman</span></strong><span> for bows, guns torches and warhorns</span></li><li><strong><span>Jeweler</span></strong><span> for trinkets (amulet, ring, earring)</span></li><li><strong><span>Leatherworker</span></strong><span> for medium armor</span></li><li><strong><span>Scribe</span></strong><span> for guildhall decorations</span></li><li><strong><span>Tailor</span></strong><span> for light armor</span></li><li><strong><span>Weaponsmith</span></strong><span> for melee weapons and shields (axe, dager, sword etc)</span></li></ul><p><span>Besides that most professions can craft either runes or sigils as well as some other things. A full list of what each profession can craft can be found </span><a href='https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting'><span>on the wiki</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Disciplines usually go from level 0 to level 500, unlocking new recipes with higher levels.

While a full guide would not be in scope for this tutorial, here are a few quick tips how you can get a decent start.</span></p><ul><li><span>Do the daily completionist achievement. For it you have to complete 3 of the daily achievements. While that might be hard in the early early beginning it is a good way to get 2 gold per day for relatively little effort.</span></li><li><span>Check if you can sell your loot over the trading post instead of selling it to merchants.</span></li><li><span>Especially when new to the game it can be good to join dungeon runs. While they are not the most bang for the buck they offer a great learning experience with decent rewards.</span></li></ul><h3><a name="941-trading-post" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>9.4.1 Trading Post</span></h3><p><span>The trading post is the main way for players to trade items, since there is </span><strong><span>no</span></strong><span> direct player to player trading. When selling an item there is a 15% tax. 5% of that have to be paid when listing the item, the other 10% will be deducted once the item is sold.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/tp.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Trading Post"></p><blockquote><p><span>There is no direct player to player trade, so the trading post is the only official way to trade between players.</span></p></blockquote><h2><a name="95-options" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>9.5 Options</span></h2><p><span>The options menu offers quite a few options to customize how your game behaves. Here I will list some of the most important ones.</span></p><p><img src="img/en/options1.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="options1"></p><ul><li><strong><span>Content Guide</span></strong><span>: This settings enables you to customize what your content guide (top right) shows</span></li></ul><p><img src="img/en/options2.jpg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="options2"></p><ul><li><strong><span>Ground Targeting</span></strong><span>: ground targeting is a way to customize how your abilities are triggered. I personally recommend ground targeting with range indicator, but it is best to experiment</span></li><li><strong><span>Double-Tap to Evade</span></strong><span>: By default you can evade by doubletapping in a certain direction. </span><strong><span>Disable it</span></strong><span> and bind dodge to your mouse wheel. Trust me you will thank me later.</span></li><li><strong><span>Melee Attack Assist</span></strong><span>: This option prevents you from accidentally walking through an enemy when attacking. I would recommend turning it of as it prevents you from standing inside enemies.</span></li></ul><h2><a name="96-restrictions-of-a-free-to-play-account" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>9.6 Restrictions of a free to play account</span></h2><p><span>There are a few restrictions placed on free to play accounts. These exist to prevent malicious players from abusing the system. While there are a few more I will list </span></p><p><span>The most important ones here:</span></p><ul><li><span>Only 2 character slots of the initial 5</span></li><li><span>Can&#39;t leave starter maps before level 10</span></li><li><span>Can not send items or gold through mail and only send mail to mutual friends (having each other on the friendlist)</span></li><li><span>Can only see mapchat and can only whisper mutual friends or players on the same map</span></li><li><span>Can only use LfG once level 30 is reached</span></li><li><span>No login rewards</span></li><li><span>Gem Store is limited, currency exchange is only gems to gold and the trading post is restricted to certain things</span></li><li><span>No forum posting</span></li><li><span>No access to HoT or PoF content</span></li></ul><p><span>A full list of the restrictions can be found </span><a href='https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts'><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Though these might sound like harsher restrictions I still recommend anyone to use f2p in order to evaluate whether or not they will like the game. There is still hundreds of hours of content in the core game alone.</span></p></blockquote><p><a href='#guild-wars-2-new-player-tutorial'><span>To the top</span></a></p><hr /><h1><a name="chapter-10-expansions" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>Chapter 10: Expansions</span></h1><h2><a name="101-heart-of-thorns" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>10.1 Heart of Thorns</span></h2><p><span>Heart of Thorns is the first expansion to the game, it offers 5 new maps, the Mastery System, which is a way to level up after level 80 in a sideways progression, gliders (which are part of the mastery system) as well as the first Raids of the game. </span></p><p><span>It also offers a new Elite-Specialization for each class, meaning a new passive traitline, a new weapon and a fresh set of utility skills. </span></p><h2><a name="102-path-of-fire" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>10.2 Path of Fire</span></h2><p><span>Path of Fire is the second expansion of the game.
